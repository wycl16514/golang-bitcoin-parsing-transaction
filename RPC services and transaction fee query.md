We put much attetion on parsing the binary data of bitcoin which makes our work seems working along. Bitcoin is a distributed network system which means it need nodes around the world to work together,
and even a bitcoin core library needs to connect to other nodes for help, just like quering the transaction fee.

There is no free lanuch at the world. When you using bitcoin system for transaction you need to pay some fee to nodes for helping you process the transaction data. Just like banks need to pay its employee
for services. To get the right amount for transaction fee is not easy and there are some providers named RPC nodes that are providing several services for quering such info.We can use http request to query
the needed info from RPC nodes, following is link for a RPC provider for quering info for testnet:
